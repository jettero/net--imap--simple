# 
# There used to be a little stand alone server than ran in this test suite.  It
# was totally unreliable and I tired of trying to maintain it.  You must now
# test against your own server if you wish to test.  I highly recommend
# skipping the tests.  If you choose to report errors, please also explain why
# they failed.
#
### these tests are all tuned for gmail, used to test best on dovecot ###
# 
# For example, the last failures from CPAN Testers seemed to be segmentation
# faults in SSL that I couldn't reproduce at my house or at work.  Not really a
# perl problem and not really something I can fix.
#
# On the other hand, it could be a simple network or process management error.
# How can I tell from here?  TAP wasn't really set up to deal with process
# management the way I was doing it.  I gave up.
#
# If you want to test, set these environment variables and run the tests.
# These settings are intentionally un-obvious.  If you want to run automated
# tests please help debug the failures.  Automated test results against unknown
# environments help absolutely nobody at all.  Your IMAP server will differ
# from mine, so some of the tests will fail and I won't have any ability to
# figure out why without your /tmp/ logs and/or some help.  With most modules
# cpan testers is the best thing in the entire world.  With IMAP, not so much.
